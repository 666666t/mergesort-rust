# mergesort-rust
Implementing Merge Sort as an exercise in Rust and recursion.

Program was originally created as an exercise on implementing the merge sort algorithm in the rust language, 
and is a standard executable rather than a library.

As currently implemented, the program generates a vector of 10,000,000 sequential elements, and shuffles them.
